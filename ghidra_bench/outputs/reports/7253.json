The BASE version has some spaghetti logic with arbitrary jumps (`goto LAB_001012b8` and `goto LAB_00101200`). However, the PR version also uses a few arbitrary jumps (`goto LAB_001012b8` and `goto LAB_001012b6`), which reduces its score.\n\n2. **Expression Logic**: Both versions use raw pointer arithmetic and casts, but the PR version has fewer and more readable expressions. For example, `cVar3 = (&_sav_date_parse_cond_targs)[uVar7];` in PR is more idiomatic than the corresponding expression in BASE.\n\n3. **Dead Code/Redundancy**: Both versions have some dead code and redundant assignments, but the PR version has fewer instances of this.\n\n4. **Conditionals**: Both versions have some if-else chains, but the PR version has a more structured approach with clear indentation and spacing.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would say that the PR version is more human-readable, structurally sound, and idiomatic than the BASE version. However, the PR version still has some issues with arbitrary jumps, which reduces its score.\n\n**Winner: PR**\n\n**Motivation:** The PR version successfully recovered the do-while loop structure that the BASE version missed, making it more readable and maintainable. However, the PR version still has some arbitrary jumps, which reduces its score compared to the BASE version."
