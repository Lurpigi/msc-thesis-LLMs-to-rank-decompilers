Alright — let’s walk through this systematically.

---

## **1. Final Ranking (Most to Least Human-Readable)**

**1️⃣ Best – Ghidra (Decompiler N.2)**
**2️⃣ Worst – Binary Ninja (Decompiler N.1)**

---

## **2. Motivations**

### **Ghidra (N.2)** – **Rank 1**

* **Pros**

  * Function names are normalized into something a human C developer recognizes (`puts`, `system`, `cos`, etc.), with clear signatures.
  * The `askdo()` implementation reads like a rough C source file — logic flow is maintained via `switch` statements, not deep label/goto jumps.
  * Variable names (`local_38`, `local_20`, `dVar8`) are generic but consistent with C conventions.
  * Mathematical and I/O function calls look exactly like real C code.
  * Retains explicit data type information (`longdouble`, `double`, `bool`) in a recognizable C-like syntax.
  * Includes warning comments (`// WARNING: ...`) to flag uncertainty — good for a reverse engineer.
* **Cons**

  * Still has compiler artifacts like `_DAT_00104058`, `CONCAT62`, and `extraout_RDX` which break immersion.
  * Some variables (`uVar6`, `uVar7`) have cryptic types due to untyped registers.
  * Uses “flattened” constants for ANSI color strings, not named macros.

---

### **Binary Ninja (N.1)** – **Rank 2**

* **Pros**

  * Includes a lot of detail about calling conventions (`@ x87control`), `tailcall` annotations, and FPU control register handling.
  * Explicit intermediate variables for stack-based storage (e.g., `int64_t var_8 = 5`), useful for low-level analysis.
  * Gives a *complete* and *very literal* mapping from binary to C-like pseudocode, which is good for forensic-level analysis.
* **Cons**

  * **Not human-friendly**:

    * Naming is cryptic (`sub_401030`, `var_8`, `x87_r6_4`, `rax_6`).
    * Flow is verbose, with inlined constants and `goto label` style sections.
    * Too much FPU register state tracking (`__fnstcw_memmem16`, `x87control` back-and-forth).
  * Uses internal macros like `FCMP_UO`, `FCMP_O`, instead of standard `>`/`<` operators.
  * Adds cognitive load with internal stack base references (`*(fsbase + 0x28)`).
  * Repeats `system("clear");` calls instead of condensing logic.

## **3. Estimated Complexity of Each Code**

I’ll use a **McCabe-like cyclomatic complexity estimate**, based on `if`, `switch`, and loop structures.

### **Ghidra (N.2)**

* `askdo()` has:

  * Multiple `if` branches (\~6)
  * One `switch` with 10 cases
  * Some nested conditionals inside the “memory number” check
* **Complexity ≈ 15–17**
* Other functions are trivial wrappers.
* **Overall complexity**: \~20

### **Binary Ninja (N.1)**

* Same functional flow, but expressed with:

  * Even more intermediate branches due to `goto label_...`
  * Redundant FPU state save/restore sequences that count as extra branches in pseudocode.
* **Complexity ≈ 22–25**
* Overall harder to follow because logic is “flattened” into many tiny expressions.

## **4. Estimated Perplexity (Predictability)**

Here I interpret *perplexity* in the reverse engineering context as **how predictable the control and data flow is for a human reader** (lower is better).

| Decompiler | Perplexity (1–10, lower = more predictable) | Reason                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ghidra** | **3.5**                                     | Mostly standard C constructs, predictable call flow, main decision points clearly expressed.                                                      |
| **Binja**  | **7**                                       | Many register-level artifacts, nonstandard macros, verbose temporaries, and label jumps make behavior less predictable without mental simulation. |

## **5. Comparative Analysis**

| Feature                      | Ghidra (N.2)                                  | Binary Ninja (N.1)                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Naming Style**             | Uses standard C library names, generic locals | Uses raw addresses (`sub_401040`), numbered vars |
| **Structure**                | Compact `switch` for main menu logic          | Verbose, with many intermediate assignments      |
| **Branch Readability**       | Clear `if` and `switch`                       | Macro-heavy floating point comparisons           |
| **Control Flow Markers**     | Minimal labels, warnings for unknowns         | Many explicit labels and tailcall notes          |
| **Data Type Readability**    | C-like (`longdouble`, `double`)               | Low-level int sizes, special x87 tracking        |
| **Ease of Mental Execution** | Medium-high                                   | Low — requires simulating registers              |
| **Low-level Fidelity**       | Medium                                        | High (good for exact behavior replication)       |

---

✅ **Summary:**

* **If you’re reconstructing source code for understanding / documentation** → **Ghidra output is better**.
* **If you’re doing security auditing, patching, or exact binary reproduction** → **Binary Ninja output is more precise** but harder to read.

If you want, I can **rewrite the `askdo()` from both decompilers into the most human-readable C possible** while preserving exact behavior — that would make side-by-side readability even clearer. This would also let us *quantify* the cognitive gap between the two outputs. Would you like me to do that next?
