### Motivations  

| Decompiler | Control‑flow clarity | Function organization | Expression predictability | Structural economy | Overall impression |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **N. 3**  | Uses two *separate* `if` blocks; no nesting, no labels/gotos.  The path of execution is immediately obvious. | Single entry/exit, no hidden tail‑calls. | Pure C expressions (`a1==1`, `a2==1`). | No extra temporaries; each print call is a direct statement. | Highest readability. |
| **N. 1**  | Nested `if`/`else` structure, but still conventional C syntax. | Same simple layout. | Standard C expressions. | One additional indentation level, but no unnecessary temporaries. | Good readability, slightly more complex than N. 3. |
| **N. 2** | Introduces a `goto L1;` and a label `L1:`.  The jump breaks the straight‑line flow, making the execution path harder to follow. | Same simple entry/exit. | Standard C expressions, but the `goto` clutters the control‑flow graph. | No extra temporaries, but the label/goto increase structural noise. | Lowest readability. |

### Comparative analysis  

1. **Control‑flow structure**  
   - **N. 3** is entirely linear: two independent `if` statements. The logical path is one straight line, with no branching that is hidden behind a label.  
   - **N. 1** still follows a clear nested `if/else` hierarchy, but the reader must keep track of two levels of nesting.  
   - **N. 2** uses a `goto` to skip the `printf("5");` when `a1 != 1`. The presence of a label forces the reader to mentally jump back, which is a deviation from standard C control‑flow patterns.

2. **Function organization**  
   All three functions have a single entry point at the beginning and a single exit at the end (`return 0`). None of them have inline tail‑calls or wrapper functions that fragment the flow.

3. **Expression predictability**  
   Every decompiler emits the same logical tests (`a1==1`, `a2==1`, `a1!=1`). There are no macro expansions or register‑level artifacts that obscure the meaning of the operations.

4. **Structural economy**  
   - **N. 3** has no intermediate temporaries; the compiler‑like output is a direct translation of the high‑level logic.  
   - **N. 1** also has no spurious temporaries, but the nesting adds one layer of boilerplate.  
   - **N. 2** is equivalent in terms of temporaries but introduces the label, which is a structural overhead.

Overall, **DEWOLF (N. 3)** presents the cleanest, most straightforward C‑style code. **Binary‑ninja (N. 1)** is still quite readable but slightly more complex due to nested `if/else`. **Ghidra (N. 2)**, while functionally correct, sacrifices readability by inserting a `goto`, which is the most obfuscating element among the three.
