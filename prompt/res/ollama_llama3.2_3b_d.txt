Based on my analysis, here is the ordered list:

1. binary-ninja:
   - Final ranking: Best
   - Motivation: The output from binary-ninja appears more human-readable than the other two outputs due to its detailed and organized structure. It provides a clear indication of which functions are being called, how they are being used, and what data is being passed between them.
   - Complexity: High
   - Perplexity: Low

2. Ghidra:
   - Final ranking: Second best
   - Motivation: The output from Ghidra appears to be less human-readable than binary-ninja's output due to its unconventional structure and lack of clear organization. However, it still provides a good indication of the overall functionality of the program.
   - Complexity: Medium
   - Perplexity: Medium

3. Ghidra (decompiler errors):
   - Final ranking: Worst
   - Motivation: The output from Ghidra contains several decompiler errors that make it difficult to understand, such as "WARNING: Unknown calling convention -- yet parameter storage is locked." These errors hinder the ability to accurately analyze and understand the code.
   - Complexity: Low
   - Perplexity: High

These differences in ranking are due to various factors, including:

- The level of organization and structure used by each decompiler to represent the code. Binary-ninja uses a more conventional structure that is easier to understand, while Ghidra's output appears less organized.
- The amount of information provided about each function call, such as the parameters being passed and the data being returned. Binary-ninja provides more detailed information than Ghidra, which makes it easier to understand how the code works.
- The presence of decompiler errors in Ghidra's output. These errors hinder the ability to accurately analyze and understand the code, making Ghidra's output less useful for reverse engineering purposes.

In general, the choice of decompiler should be based on factors such as the level of detail required, the complexity of the code, and any potential issues with the decompiler's accuracy.
